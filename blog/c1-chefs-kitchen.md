Fireside Real Talk

Your attitude REALLY MATTERS

23 Nov 2014

DevBootcamp, thank you for accepting me.

Based on the video, what's your take on the DBC experience?
I think the DBC experience is going to be an intense one. Bootcamp is literally in the title of this course. I haven't ever engaged in an environment like DBC.

What is your impression of DBC?
So far, DBC has completely impressed me with understanding that emotions factor in on the learning experience. I have struggled with the Imposter Syndrome and time management throughout my entire school career, and they are finally address it. I understand they want us to grow as an overall good person, learner, AND programmer.

How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?
From the Fireside video, I realize that this experience will be what I make of it. I have to go in with a BANG-like attitude. I have to want this for this bootcamp to work for me. DBC is set up for you to do things, but you have to be self-motivated and DO THEM WELL.

Have your expectations of DBC changed? If so, how?
After week one, I realize that this is going to be my life. My only changed expectation is the amount of time I need to dedicate to DBC, especially for Phase 0.

Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment?
I am so incredibly excited. I have been excited since I got the acceptance email. I got teary-eyed from that email. I have to control sitting still in my seat with each "ah-ha!" moment during challenges. This environment, like all environments, is going to take adaptation. I'm willing and able and open and ready. I'm here.

Does it make you nervous?
DBC makes me nervous when I think about where other students are in their coding careers. I am just starting out. I am brand new. What if other people have coded before? What if they're fluent in Ruby? Will they avoid pairing with me because I'm so new? What-ifs make me nervous. But I'm still more excited than nervous.
