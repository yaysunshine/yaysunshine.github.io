      <h3>for the abstract random learners</h3>
      <h4>6 Dec 2014</h4>

      <section>
        <p>
           So here we go. All about me. Ready?
        </p>
        <p>
          I am an abstract random learner. This means I'm <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=wassily+kandinsky&espv=2&biw=967&bih=480&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ei=Pc-EVMu-Msb1oASc24KQAw&sqi=2&ved=0CAYQ_AUoAQ#facrc=_&imgdii=_&imgrc=RsfDVficKfdV-M%253A%3B4hhWVfoAdII7zM%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fupload.wikimedia.org%252Fwikipedia%252Fen%252F4%252F49%252FKandinsky_WWI.jpg%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fen.wikipedia.org%252Fwiki%252FWassily_Kandinsky%3B800%3B534">Wassily Kandinsky</a>. Just kidding! What it really means is two things. First, abstract learners naturally visualize in order to understand things without actually seeing something. When I say, "I see what you're saying" that's because I literally see. For instance, I can see the way you want your code set up; I can see you want that Marilyn Monroe <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=marilyn+monroe&espv=2&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ei=FdCEVKiaEZe0oQTU_4HICg&ved=0CAYQ_AUoAQ&biw=967&bih=480#tbm=isch&q=marilyn+monroe+pop+art&facrc=_&imgdii=_&imgrc=z44V6YxbDXJaTM%253A%3BwppuynfozM4WdM%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fpopuppainting.com%252Fwp-content%252Fuploads%252F2013%252F08%252Fmarilyn-stripes.jpg%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fpopuppainting.com%252Fevent%252Fpaint-pop-art-holly-bush-hampstead-27-may%252F%3B399%3B550">pop art</a> hung above the couch because it brings out the yellow in the pillows; I can see that you're hurt because of that asshole ex of yours. I didn't realize how often I would do this, but I visualize all the dam time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly, random learners are able to attack things from all sides. I think in chunks.
        </p>
        <p>
          So my next question is...this doesn't sound like coding AT ALL. Why am I doing this...Well, I want to. I want to attack computer programming and no matter what make DBC an outrageous, lovely learning experience that will benefit me for the rest of my life. My go-get-em attitude aside, my abstract random Gregorc Thinking Style has many <a href="http://facstaff.gpc.edu/~jgutliph/Books/learning_styles/Abstract_Random.html">benefits</a> to it. Personally, I don't have problems asking for help...ok maybe sometimes I get embarrassed, but I still ask. I need to have time to work by myself and personally reflect. Ever since high school, I would leave each class with pages of notes. I learn best by writing down most everything and then reading it back and speaking out loud. I have to interpret, re-name, and make more examples for myself. Really diving into something helps me learn.
        </p>
        <p>
          Environmentally, I strive when the people around me are as motivated as I am. That's why I preferred honors and AP classes. I see so many complaints of group work, but I love working with people. I do not do well with competition. I am a nice, friendly person becuase I like nice, friendly people.
        </p>
        <p>
          At this point, let's talk about my most frustrating times at DBC. Three weeks in, my biggest, most fRuStRaTiNg problem was my Windows laptop. Two days ago I finally made the switch and got a Mac. I am so much hApPiEr. Things are actually working as I see them happen on videos. There is so much more help and information about developing with Macs than Windows. The system is so much smoother. Most things take less steps than with a PC.
        </p>
        <p>
          I
        </p>
        <p>
          am
        </p>
        <p>
          never
        </p>
        <p>
          going
        </p>
        <p>
          back
        </p>
        <p>
          !
        </p>
        <p>
          In all seriousness, coding is like building a house. I can't build the house when my hammer isn't working. It's a strain to focus on the curriculum when my laptop isn't working.
        </p>
        <p>
          Well I can learn from this frustration. That's what a growth mindset is all about. That's what being well-rounded is all about. I think it's natural (I didn't say normal because I don't particularly like that work) to experience frustration. A friend asked me how the bootcamp was going and I replied, "Frustrating, but rewarding." Opposite feelings, but both present each time I do a challenge. When I complete a challenge, I am so uplifted. And I don't want to stop. I want to keep learning and fueling myself. I (already) fell in love with coding because there is so much to learn, and there always will be. This is my attitude, my Gregorc thinkging style, and a growth mindset combined: to never stop.
