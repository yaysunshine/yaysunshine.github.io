      <h1>Values</h1>
      <h4>23 Jan 2015</h4>

      <section>
       <p>
        Values! You know, I went to write/speak/code..oh goodness must have been like 4 months ago. Anyway, I remember a certain point of the presentation when we were asked something about what we value.
      </p>
      <p>
        I don't think you understand how hard it is to verbalize what you value until you're being asked to verbalize it. Like trying to do a hand stand.
      </p>
      <p>
        Well today I'm doing the same: what value was present at some of the happiest, proudest moments of my life?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>pleasure, accomplishment, affection, effectiveness, friendship, family, inspiration, stability</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Now I have to rate them: do I live up to these values? 1 (disagree) - 5 (agree)
      </p>
      <p>
        Pleasure - 5 - good or bad, I have come to the realization that I'm a people pleaser.
      </p>
      <p>
        Accomplishment - 4 - I mean yeah feeling accomplished is a GREAT feeling. Getting work done and completed and submitted is amazing. I don't live for it, but I like the feeling.
      </p>
      <p>
        Affection - 5 - yeah so on the other hand, I live for affection. I'm friendly (though I do have my moments...), and I want the world to be friendly. You're returned what you put out.
      </p>
      <p>
        Effectiveness - 5 - oh dude. So important with coding, am I right? I will (and do! or at least try to) strive for this.
      </p>
      <p>
        Friendship - 5 - so important.
      </p>
      <p>
        Family - 5 - hugely important.
      </p>
      <p>
        Inspiration - 5 - here's the thing: I see it in others. Like holy cow. So many people inspire me. Wouldn't it be lovely to be inspirational for others? I don't know, maybe this goes along with pleasure? Oh well it's on my blog now.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lastly, stability - 3 - I will eventually get this down. It's here because I admire it so much in others.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's talk about pleasure though. Really. Why not. It's great. Be pleased, be pleasing, bathe in pleasurliness. Not a word. Hmm. Bathe in sunshine. There we go.
      </p>
      <p>
        Pleasure is enjoyment. You have to love your life. Don't keep yourself in a situation where you're unhappy. Be pleasing. Be sunshine.
      </p>
      <p>
        See: bathe in sunshine, be sunshine. It's a two way street. That's probably why I like it. Making others feel good makes me feel good. What more is there to say? Pleasure is a value I like.
      </p>
      <p>
        Moving on: what was the last topic that someone asked for your advice on? Did it relate to any of the values you found important?
      </p>
      <p>
        My girlfriend and some "guy drama", but of course because we're young and guys are foolish. Anyway, it was more intense than some middle school bs, so to me it related to affection. Affection between the two of them and then affection from me towards her for what she was going through. That's what she and I are there for. This situation also related to friendship in my opinion because she trusted me and told me what was going on. And I trust her and tell her what's going on. Mutual feelings make a friendship.
      </p>
      <p>
        In conclusion, humans change. I can change my mind at any moment, but right now these values are part of how I define myself. They shape me. They make me who I am.
      </p>
      <p>
        When who I am is threatened by stereotypes (see what I did there), I can refer back to my values. Remembering, for example, that I want to be an inspiration can keep me level headed when I get heated. Remembering that I want to be lovely, be pleasing, will remind me that what I put out is what I get returned. Remembering the value of family and friends will make me always feel loved. Beyond my values, I'm happy to say I found that music, walking, talking, writing, and hugs all make me feel better if I'm ever down. So. Much. More. But for now, literally walking has been so helpful these past 8 weeks.
      </p>
      <p>
        Great exercise. What are some of your values? How do these things help you? Share with <a href="https://twitter.com/ckennedyay?lang=en">me</a>.
