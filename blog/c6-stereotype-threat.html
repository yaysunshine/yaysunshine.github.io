          "When you feel under threat, you know that based on an identity you have, something bad could happen." -Dr. Claude Steele (<a href="http://www.diversityinc.com/diversity-events/the-stereotype-threat-dr-claude-steele-mesmerizes-audience-video/">The Stereotype Threat</a>)
        </p>
        <p>
          If that's not a powerful statement, then I don't know what is.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Give a girl the right shoes, and she can conquer the world." -Marilyn Monroe
        </p>
        <p>
          Ok that's a pretty good one, too. Actually there are many powerful statements in the world. But that's not my point. Focus. So. Let's break down stereotype threat. Stereotype is basically how you subconsciously feel about yourself based on society and your genetic, basically blood background (can someone say hayyy alliteration! No? Ok, nevermind). Stereotyping also includes what group you - and those around you - determine you reside in.
        </p>
        <p>
          And there are an OMG load of groups: cultural, religious, economic, where you come from, the group you hang out with at school, how you wear your pants, where you play sports, what sports you play, where your house is, what neighborhood you grew up in, what neighborhood you live in now, there are literally so many factors that we could learn <em>fluent JavaScript</em> before naming all the society-determined groups that classify us.
        </p>
        <p>
          But who does the classifying? <em>Weeee doooooo.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          Don't trip though because apparently it's subconscious. Also, our peers and society are hugely to blame. But we stop that discussion there.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now let's talk about the threat part. A threat. Ok think about when you feel threatened. Personally, I get defensive. Like immediately. I try to see a way around how I'm being approached. I try to pinpoint a way to turn the situation around in my favor and get off the defensive. (This is all referring to verbal discourse, you guys, ok. I'm not like a lion trying to find a way out of danger, sorry to disappoint).
        </p>
        <p>
          Dang. A threat plus a stereotype. Obviously we'd perform bad! When we're defensive, we're not the best Catie possible. And we all stereotype. Don't try and bullshit that. We all do it. I classify myself all the dam time. I did it on the front page of my website.
        </p>
        <p>
          All that being said, first off, we have to get real. Like I said, we all stereotype. But!!!! I think we can choose <em>who</em> and <em>what</em> and <em>how</em> we stereotype. I think I would like to stick with female (pa-lease). I can't change that I'm of European decent. I can't change that I'm 5'2" (unless I'm wearing those Jessica Simpsons <em>amiright</em>). I can't change that my chest and neck and face turn tomato red when I get nervous or upset.
        </p>
        <p>
          I can change where I work, so the career group I choose to merge myself with will stereotype me - by choice. I can change where I live. I can change what I get flustered over. I can change how I see myself: right now I see my bed head hair that just won't deal with life in the right way, but hey man I like my smile! Stereotypical things are under my control.
        </p>
        <p>
          But that's if I lend myself the power to control them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because if I'm stereotyping myself, then I'm stereotyping others. Stereotyping can be dealt with positively. I want to be welcoming. I want to be kind. I want to get along with people. I will give you a chance until you prove to me not to give you a chance. Smile-unless-it's-a-creeper type of attitude.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ladies. We stereotype ourselves. We are powerful. I can do anything you can do but in heels, ok. Stereotyping motivates me. I want to prove. I want to be successful and share my story and make sure other women go out there in the business world and do the same. We all, no matter what stereotype you are in, deserve chances and privileges.
        <p>
          I don't think how you put yourself out there is what people see. I think a better approach is to act in a way that you want others to act. I want a smile from you, Mr. Handsome walking down the street, so I will smile at you while passing. Just you watch.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ok if that last part doesn't especially resonate with you, basically, I will approach life openly. Open hearts. Open smile. If I'm uncomfortable, I will talk about it. And watch the fuck out because I do plan to be a successful woman, and I will make women realize our IMMENSE power. I'll show you.
