          "When you feel under threat, you know that based on an identity you have, something bad could happen." -Dr. Claude Steele (<a href="http://www.diversityinc.com/diversity-events/the-stereotype-threat-dr-claude-steele-mesmerizes-audience-video/">The Stereotype Threat</a>)
        </p>
        <p>
          Stereotype threat is confirming a negative stereotype.
        </p>
        <p>
          For instance, there is a stereotype that females are not good drivers. Having this in the back of my mind, I am constantly self-conscious about how I drive. I hate having others in the car. Most specifically, I hate making turns too wide. The stereotype threat lies in my fear of performing wrong and when I do perform wrong, it heightens my belief in the stereotype.
        </p>
        <p>
          On a more related note, you guys best believeeee I am threatened by my stereotype: women shouldn't code.
        </p>
        <p>
          Apparently it's a career we shouldn't choose. We can't do it. It's not girly. It doesn't involve cooking or cleaning. It doesn't involve taking care of children. There are currently more men then women, so we just clearly are not good at it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Those reasons are utterly pathetic, but of course they cross my mind. What if I'm not cut out for this? What if I won't be wanted because I am a girl?
        </p>
        <p>
          But these are what I call <em>what-ifs</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Like stereotype threat, what-ifs damage how I perceive myself. When I see I am using up my brain power like that, I immediately intend to stop it.
        </p>
        <p>
          I plan to think of my accomplishments and about things that make me happy. Tuning into music helps me (I turn on the radio if I feel judged about my driving).
        </p>
        <p>
          Feeling threatened is not a good feeling. That was putting it lightly. My point is that I don't like the feeling, so I would be so willing to help someone if they were feeling down. For instance, hugs make me feel better, so I would want someone to hug me if they saw I was feeling down. But not everyone wants a hug when they're blue. I would help someone with their stereotype threat by talking it out and seeing what would make them feel better. Because we're all different and want different things at different times.
        </p>
        <p>
          That's why being a successful woman matters to me. I want to be able to prove to others that women belong in whatever world and whatever career they work for.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because at the end of the day:
