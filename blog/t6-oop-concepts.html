      <h1>Scoping Ice Cream</h1>
      <h3>Yes, I know it's "scooping", but stick with me.</h3>
      <h4>23 January 2015</h4>
What kinds of variables does Ruby support? Where are they accessible? When would you use them and what makes them different?
      <section>
        <p>
          Ruby has many variables. They are as plentiful as flavors of ice cream. Ok, well maybe not so many. But let's choose a few flavors: vanilla (global), chocolate (instance), Mexican chocolate (local), class (grasshopper pie), and the simple syntax of an equal sign (cookies and cream).
        </p>
        <p>
          Global variables are vanilla because both are good bases. Global variables can be accessed anywhere in a code just as you can find vanilla in so many flavors. Global variables' good quality is that they can be traced. On the flip side, global variables should not be used often. They can be initialized (created) anywhere in the code and used anywhere in the code. It just makes things messy. Like vanilla, global variables are mediocre.
        </p>
        <p>
          Next is my favorite: chocolate! Instance variables are the bomb. I use these as frequently as I order chocolate ice cream. As chocolate ice cream is bound to chocolate sauce, instance variables are bound to a class. They are initialized within a class and the definition of the variable stays there while the term created ("@chocolate" for example) can be used else where in the following code.
        </p>
        <p>
          So what happens when we add cinnamon and other taste bud provokers to chocolate ice cream? Local variables! Mexican chocolate taste great within itself. Add the spices to a different flavor, and your taste buds will raise an error. Local variables are only available inside the method in which it is initialized. We can say that sentence in another way: the scope of a local variable only extends to the method in which it is defined.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ok man. Grasshopper pie from SF's <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/mitchells-ice-cream-san-francisco">Mitchell's Ice Cream</a> is legitimately the best dam ice cream you will ever have in your life. Or not. But it's like up there with pizza for me. Anyway, class variable syntax is similar to instance variables: @@grasshopper_pie. It's important to remember that when you set a class variable, you set it for all. So calling grasshopper pie my favorite ice cream flavor is setting that flavor as my favorite for the class of ice cream. Forever. Or until I, or my taste buds, write another code.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lastly, it is easiest to set a word to a value with an equal sign. This is like cookies and cream because the flavor cookies and cream is not the same if it is just cookies or just cream. You get me? They need each other. You need something on both sides of the equal sign. The word on the left is your variable name. The word or value on the left is the variable value.
        </p>
        <p>
          I hope this is making sense. If nothing does, at least check out Mitchell's.
