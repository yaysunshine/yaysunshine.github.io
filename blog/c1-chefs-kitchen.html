        <p>
          DevBootcamp, thank you for accepting me.
        </p>
        <p>
          Based on the video, what's your take on the DBC experience? I think the DBC experience is going to be an intense one. Bootcamp is literally in the title of this course. I haven't ever engaged in an environment like DBC.
        </p>
        <p>
          What is your impression of DBC? So far, DBC has completely impressed me with understanding that emotions factor in on the learning experience. I have struggled with the Imposter Syndrome and time management throughout my entire school career, and they are finally address it. I understand they want us to grow as an overall good person, learner, AND programmer.
        </p>
        <p>
          How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture? From the Fireside video, I realize that this experience will be what I make of it. I have to go in with a BANG-like attitude. I have to want this for this bootcamp to work for me. DBC is set up for you to do things, but you have to be self-motivated and DO THEM WELL.
        </p>
        <p>
          Have your expectations of DBC changed? If so, how? After week one, I realize that this is going to be my life. My only changed expectation is the amount of time I need to dedicate to DBC, especially for Phase 0.
        </p>
        <p>
          Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? I am so incredibly excited. I have been excited since I got the acceptance email. I got teary-eyed from that email. I have to control sitting still in my seat with each "ah-ha!" moment during challenges. This environment, like all environments, is going to take adaptation. I'm willing and able and open and ready. I'm here.
        </p>
        <p>
          Does it make you nervous? DBC makes me nervous when I think about where other students are in their coding careers. I am just starting out. I am brand new. What if other people have coded before? What if they're fluent in Ruby? Will they avoid pairing with me because I'm so new? What-ifs make me nervous. But I'm still more excited than nervous.
