      <h1>Since It's What I Wanna Do</h1>
      <h4>25 January 2015</h4>

      <section>
        <p>
          I'm going to research how computers work. There's probably a whole lot that I'm not going to include in this, but I'll do my best. So.
        </p>
        <p>
          Two basic needs: hardware and software. Hardware is the things you physically see like the keyboard, the screen. It's the skin and makeup. Software is the inside: the bones and guts. Software is programs installed or that you choose to install on the computer such as Chrome (operating system software) or Microsoft Office (application software).
        </p>
        <p>
          Now we know what makes up a computer. Next: where do computers work? The CPU: Central Processing Unit. This is so complex that this is where I'm going to leave some things out. Sorry.
        </p>
        <p>
          Well the CPU has two main parts: the control unit and the arithmetic / logic unit. Like air and water. The control unit is like air or breath because it directs other parts of the system to do things. We breathe and then type. We breathe and then eat. We have to breathe to circulate the good stuff you know. Ok and the arithmetic / logic unit is like water because they both do amazing things. The "water" unit includes arithmetic (obviously) and the ability to compare. This is important for being able to see things like when there are empty seats on the plane, when someone has more points than the other, or if something is greater than, less than, or equal to the other.
        </p>
        <p>
          What's next? Well I want to investigate why people say computers are stupid.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am still learning how tedious I have to be when telling (in the most polite way I know how) a computer what to do. I have to know every bit of it's language before successfully communicating with a computer.
        </p>
        <p>
          I don't know how original this example is, but try and tell a computer to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. It's so painful.
        </p>
        <p>
          You know what to do: bread, spread peanut butter, spread jelly, put bread on top, consume.
        </p>
        <p>
          UH no. With a computer you have to define where the bread came from, get out a piece of bread, where the knife to spread the peanut butter came from, where the jar for the peanut butter is, how to put the knife in the jar, how to spread, how to now go to the jelly jar, how to put the knife in the jar, how to spread the jelly, how to put the knife down, how to get another piece of bread, how to put the bread on top, how to pick up the sandwich, how to direct it toward the mouth, how to bite, how to chew, how to swallow, and repeat until no more sandwich.
        </p>
        <p>
          I hope you didn't read all those steps. But you see the difference? Things we <em>know</em> implicitly need to be so explicit for a computer. A computer can do amazing things, but we have to tell it when to use those amazing qualities. It won't perform on its own. Until artificial intelligence, which I'm not getting into.
