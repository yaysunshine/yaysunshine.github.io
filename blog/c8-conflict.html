      <h1>Oh My Goodness Girl</h1>
      <h4>25 Jan 2015</h4>

        <p>
          We all have our middle school fights. I was not the "popular group". I had my select friends and they had me and we were Twilight fans with each other (don't judge). So there was this one girl, let's call her Diana. Diana was so fake. I swear she tried so hard to be included and liked by the "popular" folk. That's not what bothered me though.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let's look at facts. I was new to the school, and the principal assigned her to be my buddy for the day so I got used to the school and the kids and how stuff worked and yada yada.
        </p>
        <p>
          What bothered me was: she left me! We walked up the stairs. Sat down. Break came and she was gone. She was off trying to be a part of the populars. I saw her run with them. No looking back. Of course I was weirded out and hurt! I'll never forget Diana. First day of school and the person who is supposed to be with me isn't. Oh my goodness girl like thanks for showing me how not to be.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm not that hurt anymore, but you can imagine. So now looking back, the source of the conflict was her leaving me and then me getting hurt and confused and lost.
        </p>
        <p>
          I never confronted her. I've actually never told her. But I was never her friend, and she knew it.
        </p>
        <p>
          If I could go back, I would have verbalized to her how I was feeling. Maybe she could have said "oh you got lost / I'm sorry / I'm here!" Something. It just made the following years unnecessarily awkward.
        </p>
        <p>
          I did learn from this. She taught me to speak up for myself. She also taught me to not hold onto small things. I'm over it now, but I can still remember the feeling of being lost.
