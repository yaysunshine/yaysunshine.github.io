        <p>
           DBC has introduced me to some amazing people. We <em>get</em> to peer pair. It's a requirement, but I feel like it's a privilege...especially after having to do solo challenges...
        </p>
        <p>
          What is is like to pair with others to solve challenges? So rewarding because things actually get solved!!! I find a pace with whoever I work with and we code and get along from there. Even remotely, the learning environment from pairing with people is so focused. And ready. And open. And determined. It's fabulous.
        </p>
        <p>
          Peer pairing is particularly rewarding because I get to work with another mind. Coding involves logic (among other things). I sometimes can't think through things properly or in as concisely as someone else; therefore, the greatest thing about pairing is learning. I am falling in love with coding because of the people, the ability to collaborate with coding, and the CONSTANT learning. Again, it's fabulous.
        </p>
        <p>
          My most frustrating moment (which I mentioned in paragraph 6 <a href="http://yaysunshine.github.io/blog/c3-thinking-style.html">here</a>) was when code on my pc (because I began DBC with my Windows) kept failing, but the exact same code worked perfectly on my pair's mac. If I hadn't been pairing, I would have never ever figured out that my computer environment was trippin.
        </p>
        <p>
          DBC also allows us to partake in anonymous feedback. I have come to understand how important feedback is because of the feedback that I have received. I like that I am allowed to see what others think about working with me.
        <p>
          While reading my feedback, these wonderful anonymous people made me feel really good about myself. Overall people enjoyed my enthusiasm and willingness to learn. If I had studied before pairing with them on a challenge, it was noticed. I sincerely appreciate when people give me something actionable.
        </p>
        <p>
          After reading my feedback, I have been making feedback that I give to other people more ASK-like: actionable, kind, specific. I noticed that if I have an idea or a problem with something I sometimes ramble, so I have begun slowing down and articulating what I want to say. I also have been making sure I let people around me know I am going to pair so that the environment on my side is more quiet.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have been writing feedback with a focus on being kind, and I didn't see a need to change this until I began receiving actionable feedback. Since my feedback is fairly progressive, I want to do the same for others. The only problem I see with trying to be actionable with others is that I feel like I learn so much from others that there isn't really a need to tell them something. I am just grateful at the end of most of my pairings. Jotting down notes about something that sticks out in my mind about my pair would help me write more concise feedback.
        </p>
        <p>
          Pairing and feedback are an improvement on like school group projects or English class discussion. The one-on-one of pairing and the actionable aspect of feedback are insanely helpful, at least for me. DBC has been so insightful about learning style and emotional intelligence. The set up of pairing and feedback is a platform for us to practice what we learn about ourselves and about code. I really enjoy working with others.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am very loving towards pairing and feedback (and accountability groups, though that's not the topic of this blog necessarily)...they are a few of my favorite things

          aaand then iiii don't feeeel soo bad
