Git It Together

A diary for newbies

If it were human, I would put a ring on version control. I think it would be a great partnership. I have to say, the expansive memory is what won me over. With a memory like that, I would know all of the commands for the command line... It records everything I commit to it, but it's also forgiving. I can view everything I've committed to it, and it can let me go back and make changes to something I've already committed (I mean, hey, I'm only human and we like to change things). I don't have to worry about loosing files. It tracks my progress so I can see how awesome I am. I love that I can see what I DEVeloped (get it) a project into!

But version control is just a system, just a way of doing something. I can't access this system of version control without a software. I need a way to tell version control, "I want to commit this to you and you can do your thing of remembering and recording and tracking. It's my heart; don't HURT IT PLEASE."

To communicate with version control, we use the software: git. So if I marry version control, I am also marrying git. Because three's a party. Anyway, git is a version control software. Is it making sense now? See how this all comes together? Git (once installed) is what is actually remembering and recording and tracking and making your heart swell.

With all this, you ever feel like...yeah git and version control are great and all, but I want to share my greatness with the world!!!!!!! *fire emogi*

Well. That's what GitHub is for. GitHub is an online, file-saving masterpiece. You access GitHub from the web, pull documents and files from a project you want to work on using git, and git puts those documents on your computer so you can access it locally and work on it yourself. When you push the document back to GitHub, your work 1) is now available for others to see, and 2) does not change the base document.

It's literally magic when you use git and GitHub together. Have fun.
