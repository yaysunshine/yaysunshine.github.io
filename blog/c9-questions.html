      <h1>Quality Questions</h1>
      <h4>27 Jan 2015</h4>

      <section>
        <p>
          Why is the sky blue? What makes a car go? Why do humans not have tails? What is the difference between Ruby and JS?
        </p>
        <p>
          These are way too broad. A quality question has details and asks exactly what you want to know.
        </p>
        <p>
          How is light reacting to make the sky the color blue instead of red? Where is the pedal pushing on a car in order for the machine to move? What is the evolution of humans? How are Ruby methods different from JavaScript functions?
        </p>
        <p>
          These questions are totally random, I know, but my point is to point out (haha) the biggest difference between being specific and being vague.
        </p>
        <p>
          What it all boils down to (why is this a saying? -- no -- <em>where</em> did this saying come from?): be honest.
        </p>
        <p>
          What exactly do you want to know?
        </p>
        <p>
          I apply this to life. Like when a someone is being vague and annoyingly distant, I ask what is up. When someone has a sour look on their face, I ask them what they're thinking. If I want to know how my outfit looks, I ask "how do I look?"
        </p>
        <p>
          And you know. This is great practice. We'll use the example of "how do I look?"
        </p>
        <p>
          It's kind of a vague question. I ask it, but then I usually follow up with: "too much eyeliner?", "does my butt look nice and big?", "am I showing too much skin?", "what should I do to my hair to make it less frizzy?", etc. I try to get more specific. When asking someone a question, what do I want them to look at?
        </p>
        <p>
          Let's now do this to code. I was so annoyed with the bingo challenge. I shouldn't have been, but hey, it happens. I was having a bad couple of weeks.
        </p>
        <p>
          Anyway, instead of making the entirety of the challenge a problem, I pinpointed what I was having the most trouble with: X-ing out when a called number matched a number on the generated board.
        </p>
        <p>
          I couldn't tell you how much hair I pulled out of my head over this. Well not exactly literally, but it was hours of "what the fuck do I do?"
        </p>
        <p>
          So I submitted what I had and then went into office hours. What ended up being the issue was figuring out how to iterate twice.
        </p>
        <p>
          Simple, I know. But now I know. I struggled, sorted through exactly what was bothering my brain, and verbalized it. And didn't let the question go until I felt secure in my ability to answer my initial question.
        </p>
        <p>
          Honestly, I <em>so enjoy</em> asking questions. Questions make the world go round. Or at least my learning world. The few times I didn't ask a question that was on my mind, I regretted it. The times when I have verbalized my questions, to anyone for any reason (but mostly in class), I learned! Like. I don't know. I haven't been that silent student. I learn best by asking questions. I'm not scared to do so.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm going to share a short story. During my first college English class, I raised my hand, the teacher called on me, and I said, "This might be a stupid question, but --"
        </p>
        <p>
          And the teacher immediately cut me off saying, "The only stupid question is the one not asked."
        </p>
        <p>
          Told you it was short. So. I will always remember that moment, and hopefully never not ask a question.
        </p>
