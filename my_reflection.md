## 4. Open Source and Repo Setup  Reflection

* Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person
* Describe what open source means
* What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
* Assess the importance of using licenses
* What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

1) On your GitHub profile page, go to the plus sign in the top right 2) select new repository 3) fill out the form: make the repository name your [username].github.io, make it public, initialize the repository with a README, add a MIT License 4) click create 5) you made it! 6) in powershell navigate to your Desktop with: cd Desktop 7) go to your DBC_stuff folder: cd DBC_stuff 7) make a new folder to store your new repo type: mkdir [username].github.io 8) navigate into that folder: cd [username].github.io 9) type: git clone #paste url 10) check your work: git remote -v 11) you should see origin and the url you pasted
Open source makes the input code of a program available to view. Most things are source code, so we can't see what a Ruby coder types to make "Hi there" appear 3 times, but with open source we can see what was typed into the program plus the "Hi there" three times.
So far I think open source is a utopia for people who want to be friendly. I can see how someone could be uneasy with putting their ideas on an open source platform because if it's a potentially profitable idea, then anyone could take the basic idea, edit it, and make it their own. That would make me protective.
Licensing gives specific permission to people who use your code or your work. You own the copyright (because it is automaticin the US) and grant permission to others individually. Open-source licensing protects you as the original creator.
The process of cloning and upstreaming to the right place, saving a file, making it ready to commit, committing it, and pushing it all solidified for me at the end with an "ahhh."
Going back through my powershell was helpful.
