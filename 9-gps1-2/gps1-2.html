            <h3><a name="what">What is Pair Programming?</a></h3>
            <p>
                Pair programming is an exercise which two programmers will work on the same code at the same time. It is meant to increase collaboration, productivity, and serve as a peer code review at the same time. One of the additional benefits is if one of the programmers has a stronger grasp on a certain concept, s/he can teach the other person while coding at the same time.
            </p>
            <h3><a name ="why">Why Is Pair Programming Important to DBC?</a></h3>
            <p>
                The learning experience at DBC is more of a holistic approach. Learning to code by itself is not as efficient as learning collaboratively. Learning to become a great programmer involves being able to work individually and kindly and efficiently with others. Part of the learning experience is being able to pass on the knowledge with others. Pair programming is a prime medium where this style of learning can develop.
            </p>
            <h3><a name="compare"></a>Compare Driver and Navigator</h3>
            <p>
                Driver and navigator are two sides of the same coin. One acts as the brain, the navigator, and the other acts as the hands, the driver, the doer. The main challenge between driver / navigator roles is communication: being open with ideas and keeping each other on the same page. The primary role of the navigator is to research the material and develop the high level approach to solving the problem. Driver, on the other hand, is responsible for understanding the approach and understanding it at the coat level while at the same time maintaining open lines of communication.
